```js

    // This algorithm can't optimize by searching from both ends since we
    // don't have backpointers on fibers. I'm trying to see how far we can get
    // with that model. If it ends up not being worth the tradeoffs, we can
    // add it later.

    // Even with a two ended optimization, we'd want to optimize for the case
    // where there are few changes and brute force the comparison instead of
    // going for the Map. It'd like to explore hitting that path first in
    // forward-only mode and only go for the Map once we notice that we need
    // lots of look ahead. This doesn't handle reversal as well as two ended
    // search but that's unusual. Besides, for the two ended optimization to
    // work on Iterables, we'd need to copy the whole set.

    // In this first iteration, we'll just live with hitting the bad case
    // (adding everything to a Map) in for every insert/move.

    // If you change this code, also update reconcileChildrenIterator() which
    // uses the same algorithm.
